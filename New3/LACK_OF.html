 			            <h3 class="text-center">Introductory Note</h3>
 			            <p>With a favourable geographical location and a coastline spanning 7,500 kms, India has the potential to be a hub of connectivity and trade for both Europe and Asia and to be a maritime hub. However, inadequate infrastructure and poor port facilities have stopped India from realising this potential. Despite an increase in traffic volume and port capacity in recent years, Indian ports continue to underperform globally.The World Bank’s global performance index, 2016 ranked India 35 out of 160 countries, behind many Asian economies such as Singapore (5), China (25), and Malaysia (32). Turn-around time for ships at major ports in India is 2.04 days, while in other countries, such as Singapore, it is less than a day. This undermines the competitiveness of Indian ports vis-à-vis its neighboring countries. India as of now has 12 major ports and over 200 minor ports.
These figures are not adequate for India to realize its full potential to be a major maritime hub and further given the fact that the amount of cargo handling is growing over the years. Cargo traffic handled by India’s major ports increased 4.97 per cent year-on-year to 616.62 million tonnes (MT) during April 2017-February 2018. The highest growth was witnessed by Cochin Port at 17.63 per cent, followed by Paradip at 15.56 per cent, Kolkata (including Haldia) at 14.29 percent and Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust at 6.37 per cent. Container traffic saw the highest growth during this period at 8.37 per cent year-on-year and reached 8,302 TEUs.
During 2016-17, major and non-major ports in India have accomplished a total cargo throughput of 1,133.09 million tonnes, an increase of 5.7 percent previous year 2015-16. The growth in cargo handled at major and non-major ports in 2016-17, were 6.8 per cent and 4.2 per cent, respectively. The share of major ports in the total traffic handled by Indian ports increased from 56.5 per cent in 2015-16 to 57.2 per cent in 2016-17.The country’s major ports handled a combined traffic volume of 647.76 million tonnes during 2016-17, registering an annual growth rate of 6.80 per cent. The major ports recorded the highest ever capacity addition of 100.37 MT in 2016-17, thereby raising the total capacity to 1065 MT per annum, as against a capacity of 965.36 MT per annum in 2015-16.[1]

 			
 			</p>

 			<p>A country that aims to seek parity with the global superpowers, certainly needs to address the issue in an
 			optimal and fool-proof manner. The current central and state level initiatives, have made significant
 			inroads while tackling the issue however, the execution still faces challenges like efficient distribution,
 			exchequer burden and more importantly, complimenting the present stock grains with the essential dietary
 			compliments to suffice the nutritional requisites. India being a state party to the Universal Declaration of
 			Human Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights is obligated to
 			ensure the right to adequate food and eradicate hunger.
 			</p>
 			            <p>Government programs like the Mid-Day Meal Scheme, Integrated Child Development Services scheme
 			and the Public Distribution System have now been translated into legal entitlements by means of the
 			National Food Security Act, 2013 which extends its reach to nearly two-thirds of the population.2 NFSA
 			along with a few handful of state initiatives comprise the food security mechanism of the country. The further sections will aim to examine the
 			loopholes and implications of the structure and consequently, provide inputs to streamline the system
 			along with the complimenting policy implications.
 			</p>
 			            <h3 class="text-center">Central Port Authority (CPA) Act, 2016</h3>

 			<p>The government of India introduced the new CPA Act in December 2016 to replace the existing Major Port Trusts Act, 1963. The new Act seeks to provide more autonomy to the country’s major ports and attempts to professionalize their governance.
Towards this end, the Act addresses a majority of the existing governance concerns, and comprises of provisions that will enable the faster development of port infrastructure. For instance, the Act empowers the board of port authority to lease land for port-related use for up to 40 years and for non-port related use, up to 20 years; the federal government’s approval will be needed only for longer leases. The port authority can also appoint consultants, raise loans, and issue securities to manage expenditure.
Under the CPA Act, the port authority will set tariffs, which will act as a reference tariff for purposes of bidding for public-private-partnership (PPP) projects; PPP operators will be free to fix tariff based on market conditions. As a result, the Act reduces litigation between the PPP ventures and ports.
Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) policy
The government allows up to 100 percent FDI under the automatic route for port and harbor construction and maintenance projects.

 			</p>


 			<p>Revised Model Concession Agreement (MCA)
In September 2016, the government released a revised MCA to encourage private sector participation in the port sector. The new MCA includes provisions, such as the substitution of the minimum guaranteed cargo requirement with the minimum guaranteed revenue, revised tariff guidelines for existing operators, and discounted revenue shares. Further, it allows private players to exit port projects after six years and gives them the power to issue bonds to refinance debt.
Fiscal Incentives
The government has also facilitated a 10-year tax holiday to companies that develop, maintain and operate ports, inland waterways, and inland ports. Furthermore, the government provides financial assistance of up to 50 percent of the cost of the port development project, subject to a maximum of US$3.88 million (Rs 25 crore).

 			</p>

 			            <h3 class="text-center">Other policies include -</h3>


 			<p>Other policies include
• In March 2018, a revised Model Concession Agreement (MCA) was approved to make port projects more investor-friendly and make investment climate in the sector more attractive.
• Project UNNATI has been started by Government of India to identify the opportunity areas for improvement in the operations of major ports. Under the project, 116 initiatives were identified out of
which 86 initiatives have been implemented*.
• The Ministry of Shipping, Government of India, released Rs 25 crore (US$ 3.86 million) as grants-in-aid
to Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust (JNPT) and Rs 50 crore (US$ 7.72 million) to the Government of Karnataka for Karwar port, for infrastructure development under the Coastal Berth Scheme of the
Sagarmala programme.
• Mr Rajnath Singh, Home Minister, Government of India, and Mr Nitin Gadkari, Minister for Shipping,
Road Transport and Highways, inaugurated a new sea route to Baratang Island and initiated various shipping projects in the Andaman and Nicobar (A&N) Islands; along with announcement of addition of 14 new ships in the A&N Islands over the next three years


 			</p>
 			<p>The Sagar Mala Project
Another initiative is the Sagar Mala project which is spearheaded by the SagarMala Development Company. 415 projects have been identified across India for port modernisation and new port development, port connectivity enhancement, port-linked industrialisation and coastal community development under the Sagarmala Initiative. The projects are to be implemented in phases at a projected cost of USD 123 Billion over 10 years, from 2015 to 2025.3 4 India’s strategic location along international trade routes, high-speed supply chains and improved port capacity will be used to boost port-led development in the country.
While logistics costs in India currently stand at 19% of GDP, the Sagarmala Programme aims at unleashing the potential of Indian ports to reduce costs and hence boost the country’s trade competitiveness.6
As per the National Perspective Plan, the programme envisages the following:

			
			</p>
 			<p>• Port modernisation and new port development
Augmenting the capacity of current port infrastructure and creating new ports is important to promote export driven growth. With massive cargo volume growth anticipated by 2025, there emerges a need for port upgradation and new infrastructure.
Under the Sagarmala initiative, the Government plans to develop six new ports across five coastal states of India. 189 projects with a projected cost of USD 21 Billion have been identified. Currently, 42 projects worth around USD 3.6 Billion are under implementation. The MoS is also pushing for improved transshipment capacity by developing transshipment ports and hubs. This is likely to bring down operations costs for shipping lines for exporters and importers. Vizhinjam (Kerala) and Enayam (Tamil Nadu)
</p>

 			<p>• Port connectivity enhancement
Enhancing port connectivity is quite a challenge in India, where trade connectivity is mostly based on road and rail infrastructure. Considering that improved port connectivity can provide the much needed boost to internal trade as well as Export and Import,170 port connectivity enhancement projects have been identified as a part of Sagarmala at a projected cost of USD 35 Billion. In addition, the new National Waterways Act, 2016 aims to facilitate the use of 111 inland waterways across 24 states as sustainable mode of transport. With the law’s enacment, several inland waterways would become National Waterways and come under the stipulated regulations for development.
Government projects such as inland container depots, Jal Marg Vikas Project, Dedicated Freight Corridors (DFCs), Bharatmala initiative and the plan for pipeline expansion will provide an impetus to development of multi-modal transport hubs, helping reduce the cost of freight transportation. With this approach, India can import and export goods at a faster rate with minimum investment.
• Port-linked industrialisation
The 33 port-linked industrialisation projects at a projected cost of USD 65 Billion, anchored by the Sagarmala Project will complement the Make in India vision.Coastal Economic Zones (CEZs) have been proposed as economic regions hosting industrial clusters. CEZs are aimed at reducing time and costs required for Export/Import movement and domestic cargo, thus becoming a focal point of Port- linked industrialisation.12 13 In addition, they have the potential to create direct and indirect employment of 4 million and 6 million respectively.
CEZs along India’s Eastern and Western coastlines will reduce logistical costs for 12 industries identified on the basis of suitability of ocean mode of transportation for import/export. These will cover energy, material and discrete manufacturing. The energy clusters containing refineries and petrochemicals industries can reduce India’s import dependence on the crude oil products. There is a potential to develop two refinery and four petrochemical clusters along the coasts of India by 2025.
</p>

 			<h3 class = "text-center">India is also developing a port at Chabahar port in Iran and it will be beneficial for the Iran- India relationship for the following reasons among others:
</h3>
 			<p>1.Chabahar is turning out to be a success story in the India-Iran relationship. With the operationalisation of the port, it is witnessing high activity, and there are unconfirmed reports of traffic being diverted from Karachi to Chabahar. In an attempt to circumvent the banking problems caused by western sanctions on Iran, India will, for the first time, allow investment in rupees in Iran. This is a special arrangement, sources said, which is only allowed for Nepal and Bhutan.This was a request from the Iranian side, acceded to by the Indian government, sources said.. </p>

 			<p>2.India is one of a handful of countries that continued trade links with Iran despite it being isolated by Western countries against its disputed nuclear programme. New Delhi is Tehran's second-biggest oil client after Beijing.</p>


 			<p>3. The project moved slowly because of western sanctions against Iran. The sanctions were lifted in January last year, and since then, India has been pushing for conclusion of an agreement.
4. The Chabahar port will cut transport costs/time for Indian goods by a third. The port is likely to ramp up trade among India, Afghanistan and Iran in the wake of Pakistan denying transit access to New Delhi for trade with the two countries.

 			</p>
 			<p>5. Iran plans to turn the Chabahar port into a transit hub for immediate access to markets in the northern part of the Indian Ocean and in Central Asia.
6. About a fifth of the oil consumed worldwide each day passes through the Strait, a shipping choke point that separates the Persian Gulf from the Gulf of Oman and Indian Ocean.
7. The Chabahar port, located in the Sistan-Baluchistan Province on Iran's southern coast, will also set up India's road access to four cities in Afghanistan.[7]

 			<h3 class = "text-center">COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS WITH CHINA</h3>
 			<p>Along with the above methodology, peripheral aids certainly need to be looked upon to bolster the
 			proficiency of the hunger eradication program. A few of them have been listed in this section </p>

 		
 			<p>China is often thought of as a continental or land power. Historically, this has generally been the case, although there have been periods of Chinese interest in the seas. The most recent occurred in the 1400s, during the late Ming Dynasty, when Admiral Zheng He (or Cheng Ho) led “treasure fleets” on several expeditions that explored the South China Sea and the Indian Ocean as far as modern-day Mogadishu on the East African coast. When Zheng He returned from his final voyage, through, China turned its back on the seas.</p>

 			

 			<p>Formation of Co-operatives and Self Help Groups holds promise in all stages of food supply and has
 			proven to be successful in the past. Such initiatives help providing a financial cushion to the stakeholders
 			and engrain a sense of empowerment and protection.

 			</p>

 			


 			<p>
			Today’s China is far more dependent on the seas than Imperial China ever was. The Chinese note that, since joining the World Trade Organization (WTO), Chinese trade with other nations has steadily expanded as a proportion of national economic activity, to the point where it affects some 60 percent–70 percent of China’s economy. Without trade, China could not sustain its economy, let alone maintain the growth rates necessary to maintain high employment figures, a 
 			</p>

 			

 			<p>
					Seaborne commerce is an essential part of Chinese trade. According to recent Chinese statistics published in the 2010 China’s Ocean Development Report, ocean commerce in 2008 alone represented 9.87 percent of China’s gross domestic product, with a valuation of nearly 3 trillion RMB (approximately $456 billion). Moreover, some 85 percent of its international trade moves by the sea lanes.
A key part of this ocean commerce is China’s increasing reliance on oil imports to sustain its economy. China imported over half of the oil it consumed in 2009 and is expected to import some 65 percent of its oil consumption by 2020. Much of that oil comes from the Middle East, including Iran and Saudi Arabia, requiring a steady flow of tankers to Chinese ports. Recent problems in Kazakhstan, including the withdrawal of Western oil companies from development of the major Kashagan oil fields on the Caspian Sea, will exacerbate this reliance on Middle East oil and maritime shipping.

 			</p>

 			

 			<p>
			Given this growing reliance on the sea, the Chinese have concluded that they must develop a strategy to govern their maritime development. According to Chinese analysts, any such strategy must address three considerations:
• The broad maritime interests of the People’s Republic of China (PRC), which include its growing reliance on the global sea lanes for its trade;
• The national security interests of the PRC including access to ocean resources, countering “hegemonic” interference in Chinese affairs, security of the sea lanes, potential for military conflict arising from conflicting claims over maritime frontiers or islands, and the Taiwan issue; and
• The need to build a “harmonious society” at sea that recognizes the inevitability of increased global competition for the sea’s resources.

 			</p>



 			<h3 class = "text-center">Future Chinese Directions</h3>
 			<p>
			As the PLA has steadily modernized its fleet, some have posited that the world is on the verge of a naval arms race, comparable to that between the United Kingdom and Imperial Germany at the turn of the 19th century or between the U.S. and Imperial Japan in the 1930s. In each case, the two sides built comparable fleets, centered on battleships and aircraft carriers, and focused on decisive “fleet actions” between their respective battle lines.
Chinese naval development, however, does not fit this pattern. For one thing, the PLAN today is hardly on the verge of challenging the U.S. for maritime dominance. The Chinese acquisition of an aircraft carrier does not, in and of itself, make China a sea power comparable to the United States. The Shi Langis a former Ukrainian carrier that has been refitted in Chinese yards—an economical approach toward rapidly fielding an aircraft carrier—but even after it is launched, the Shi Lang will still have to engage in harbor trials, sea trials, and a shakedown cruise. The ship itself is unlikely to be ready for normal operations for at least six months to a year.

			</p>

 		

 			<p>Moreover, the Chinese will also have to spend time training a core group of pilots capable of conducting flight operations from a rolling, pitching deck. In addition, they will have to assemble the supplementary support ships, including escorts and replenishment vessels, in order to allow a carrier to operate with a modicum of safety while going in harm’s way. It is this intricate ballet of ships and aircraft that allows an aircraft carrier group to exert the influence and power; such a dance, however, cannot be mastered overnight.
 			</p>

 			

 			<p>Equally as important is the fact that the PLAN does not resemble the U.S. Navy. Beijing has been building fast attack craft and submarines in large numbers, but only a handful of each of its surface combatant designs. At present, the PLAN does not look like a navy designed to exercise sea control across vast distances for extended periods of time. What the substantial numbers of submarines and fast attack craft, coupled with development of the DF-21D anti- ship ballistic missile and anti-ship cruise missiles, do suggest is that the PLA may be pursuing an asymmetric strategy at sea: one of anti-access/area denial (A2AD). It may be that the PLAN’s first priority is to keep the U.S. Navy at arm’s length, away from China’s coasts and the waters within the first island chain, rather than challenging the U.S. from the Pacific to the Atlantic..</p>

 			

 			<p>The PLAN’s present limitations will not prevent China from ultimately becoming a major maritime power; nor do they mean that it does not intend to build a substantial navy. Indeed, even before the Shi Lang launches, it is increasingly clear that the People’s Liberation Army Navy will join the ranks of major maritime powers, not only in number of major naval combatants, but also in missions it can undertake. The PLAN has already been expanding its operational sphere ever farther from its own shores. Its Gulf of Aden anti-piracy task force, now in its eighth rotation, epitomizes China’s growing ability to operate at sea for extended periods of time. China is also building a fleet of hospital ships so that it can project Chinese power from the sea in peacetime.
 			</p>
 			
 			<p>What is far less certain is whether the Chinese navy will ultimately look like the American navy. Perhaps the most important divergence between these two navies is the extent to which Chinese analysts and planners have a continental land power’s view of the sea. Chinese writings suggest that Chinese strategists perceive the sea not as a broad highway for international commerce and military deployment, but as an extension of a nation’s land borders and territorie
